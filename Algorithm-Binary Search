33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Novel Solution:
Transform rotation back to original ascending ordered array

class Solution {
public:
    int search(int A[], int n, int target) {
        int lo=0,hi=n-1;
        // find the index of the smallest value using binary search.
        // Loop will terminate since mid < hi, and lo or hi will shrink by at least 1.
        // Proof by contradiction that mid < hi: if mid==hi, then lo==hi and loop would have been terminated.
        while(lo<hi){
            int mid=(lo+hi)/2;
            if(A[mid]>A[hi]) lo=mid+1;
            else hi=mid;
        }
        // lo==hi is the index of the smallest value and also the number of places rotated.
        int rot=lo;
        lo=0;hi=n-1;
        // The usual binary search and accounting for rotation.
        while(lo<=hi){
            int mid=(lo+hi)/2;
            int realmid=(mid+rot)%n;
            if(A[realmid]==target)return realmid;
            if(A[realmid]<target)lo=mid+1;
            else hi=mid-1;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};

Follow up for "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array":
What if duplicates are allowed?

Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

Find the minimum element.
The array may contain duplicates.

NOTE:
The most important thing is to compare mid and rightmost value in the array.
