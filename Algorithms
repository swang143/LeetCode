LinkedList

147. Insertion Sort List
Algorithm - O(1) space
1. loop all nodes in a LinkedList
2. for current node in LinkedList, loop through all nodes in Sub LinkedList
3. if current node value < sub list node value; go to next node in Sub list
4. insert between prev and prev.next nodes

Note: 
1. keep Next Node once enter the first while loop
2. once find place to insert current node, setting current.next = pre.next removes current node from LinkedList, there ensures O(1) space
   because no new nodes created for insertion.
