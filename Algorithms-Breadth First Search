101. Symmetric Tree
Steps:
(1) See if the tree is null
(2) Initiate a queue(FIFO), push left child and right child into the queue
(3) While queue is not empty (We still have nodes that are going to be compared), pop up the first two nodes
    4 conditions here:
      (1) Both are null                                             -- Continue
      (2) One null and one not null                                 -- Return false
      (3) Both NOT null -- Their values are not the same            -- Return false
                        -- Their values are the same                -- Go to Step (4)

(4) ORDER MATTERS
    queue.offer(left.left);
    queue.offer(right.right);
    queue.offer(left.right);
    queue.offer(right.left);
    
    In the same level, always push nth from the front and nth from the back into the queue at the same time.
