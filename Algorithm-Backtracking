General Logic about Backtracking:
boolean Solve(Node n) {
    if (n is a leaf node) {
        if the leaf is a goal leaf, return true;
        else return false;
    
    else {
        for (each child c of n) {
            if (Solve(c) is successful) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

39. Combination Sum
Given a set of candidate numbers (C) (without duplicates) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T.

The same repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times.

Note:
All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
For example, given candidate set [2, 3, 6, 7] and target 7, 
A solution set is: 
[
  [7],
  [2, 2, 3]
]

NOTE
1. Use int remain to indicate if it's a leaf node instead of using sum, which you might need to write extra function to calculate it 
   for ArrayList. 

void backtracking() {
    if (remain < 0) // current sum > target
        return; 
    else if (remain == 0) // meet requirement, add to result set
        result.add(new ArrayList<Integer>(current));
        
    else {
        for (elements in candidates from start to end) {
            current.add(element);
            backtracking(current, i as new start, new remain) // only consider elements after i including i to avoid repeat
            remove last element of current;
        }
    }
}
